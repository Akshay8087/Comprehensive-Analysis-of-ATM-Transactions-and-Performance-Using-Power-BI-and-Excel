# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing detailed ATM transaction data to gain insights into various performance metrics and operational efficiencies. The dataset includes financial and non-financial transactions, monthly revenue, costs, and uptime statistics across multiple ATMs and states. By leveraging Power BI and Excel, dynamic dashboards and visualizations were created to track and analyze key performance indicators such as transaction volume, revenue trends, profit margins, and operational costs. The project aims to identify patterns and trends that can be used to optimize ATM operations, reduce costs, and improve overall financial performance. Key findings include identifying high-performing ATMs, understanding transaction behaviors, and highlighting areas for operational improvements.
